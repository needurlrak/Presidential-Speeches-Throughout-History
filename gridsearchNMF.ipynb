    "One can see from observation that max_df = .05 and 10 topics optimizes FTF. However, I am not going to use this configuration for my final model. There are a couple reasons. First, one can see that FTF increases as the number of topics decreases. I think this is a flaw in my metric, more than an indication that less topics is better. The goal is to give each president a signature topic but what good is a signature topic if five other presidents also have that topic as their signature? "

      "but we have always understood that when times change so must we that fidelity to our founding principles requires new responses to new challenges that preserving our individual freedoms ultimately requires collective action  for the american people can no more meet the demands of today’s world by acting alone than american soldiers could have met the forces of fascism or communism with muskets and militias  no single person can train all the math and science teachers we’ll need to equip our children for the future or build the roads and networks and research labs that will bring new jobs and businesses to our shores  now more than ever we must do these things together as one nation and one people .we understand that outworn programs are inadequate to the needs of our time  so we must harness new ideas and technology to remake our government revamp our tax code reform our schools and empower our citizens with the skills they need to work harder learn more reach higher  but while the means will change our purpose endures  a nation that rewards the effort and determination of every single american  that is what this moment requires  that is what will give real meaning to our creed .the path towards sustainable energy sources will be long and sometimes difficult  but america cannot resist this transition we must lead it  we cannot cede to other nations the technology that will power new jobs and new industries we must claim its promise  that’s how we will maintain our economic vitality and our national treasure  our forests and waterways our crop lands and snowcapped peaks  that is how we will preserve our planet commanded to our care by god  that’s what will lend meaning to the creed our fathers once declared .we meet at one of those defining moments—a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more .we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma we measure progress in the 23 million new jobs that were created when bill clinton was president—when the average american family saw its income go up 7500 instead of down 2000 like it has under george bush .its a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create american jobs look out for american workers and play by the rules of the road .ours is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves—protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education keep our water clean and our toys safe invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology .our government should work for us not against us it should help us not hurt us it should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence but for every american whos willing to work .unlike john mccain i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america .i will cut taxes—cut taxes—for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middleclass .washingtons been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years and john mccain has been there for twentysix of them in that time hes said no to higher fuelefficiency standards for cars no to investments in renewable energy no to renewable fuels and today we import triple the amount of oil as the day that senator mccain took office .as president i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power ill help our auto companies retool so that the fuelefficient cars of the future are built right here in america ill make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars and ill invest 150 billion dollars over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy—wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced .now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a worldclass education because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy michelle and i are only here tonight because we were given a chance at an education and i will not settle for an america where some kids dont have that chance ill invest in early childhood education ill recruit an army of new teachers and pay them higher salaries and give them more support and in exchange ill ask for higher standards and more accountability and we will keep our promise to every young american  if you commit to serving your community or your country we will make sure you can afford a college education .now is the time to help families with paid sick days and better family leave because nobody in america should have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a sick child or ailing parent .now many of these plans will cost money which is why ive laid out how ill pay for every dime—by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that dont help america grow but i will also go through the federal budget line by line eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less—because we cannot meet twentyfirst century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy .and democrats we must also admit that fulfilling americas promise will require more than just money it will require a renewed sense of responsibility from each of us to recover what john f kennedy called our intellectual and moral strength yes government must lead on energy independence but each of us must do our part to make our homes and businesses more efficient yes we must provide more ladders to success for young men who fall into lives of crime and despair but we must also admit that programs alone cant replace parents that government cant turn off the television and make a child do her homework that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need .thats not the judgment we need that wont keep america safe we need a president who can face the threats of the future not keep grasping at the ideas of the past .but we all know that today we have an immigration system that’s out of date and badly broken a system that’s holding us back instead of helping us grow our economy and strengthen our middle class .we have to make sure that every business and every worker in america is playing by the same set of rules  we have to bring this shadow economy into the light so that everybody is held accountable  businesses for who they hire and immigrants for getting on the right side of the law  that’s common sense  and that’s why we need comprehensive immigration reform .there’s another economic reason why we need reform  it’s not just about the folks who come here illegally and have the effect they have on our economy  it’s also about the folks who try to come here legally but have a hard time doing so and the effect that has on our economy .intel was started with the help of an immigrant who studied here and then stayed here  instagram was started with the help of an immigrant who studied here and then stayed here  right now in one of those classrooms there’s a student wrestling with how to turn their big idea  their intel or instagram  into a big business  we’re giving them all the skills they need to figure that out but then we’re going to turn around and tell them to start that business and create those jobs in china or india or mexico or someplace else  that’s not how you grow new industries in america  that’s how you give new industries to our competitors   that’s why we need comprehensive immigration reform .second we focused our enforcement efforts on criminals who are here illegally and who endanger our communities  and today deportations of criminals is at its highest level ever .but because this change isn’t permanent we need congress to act  and not just on the dream act  we need congress to act on a comprehensive approach that finally deals with the 11 million undocumented immigrants who are in the country right now  thats what we need .if you’re a foreign student who wants to pursue a career in science or technology or a foreign entrepreneur who wants to start a business with the backing of american investors we should help you do that here  because if you succeed you’ll create american businesses and american jobs  you’ll help us grow our economy  you’ll help us strengthen our middle class .good morning everybody  as you know i just met with leaders of both parties to discuss a way forward in light of the severe budget cuts that start to take effect today  i told them these cuts will hurt our economy  they will cost us jobs  and to set it right both sides need to be willing to compromise  .in high school alan watched his friends come of age  driving around town with their new licenses earning some extra cash from their summer jobs at the mall  he knew he couldn’t do those things  but it didn’t matter that much  what mattered to alan was earning an education so that he could live up to his godgiven potential .our work must begin by making some basic decisions about our budget  decisions that will have a huge impact on the strength of our recovery .over the last few years both parties have worked together to reduce the deficit by more than 25 trillion  mostly through spending cuts but also by raising tax rates on the wealthiest 1 percent of americans  as a result we are more than halfway towards the goal of 4 trillion in deficit reduction that economists say we need to stabilize our finances .in 2011 congress passed a law saying that if both parties couldn’t agree on a plan to reach our deficit goal about a trillion dollars’ worth of budget cuts would automatically go into effect this year  these sudden harsh arbitrary cuts would jeopardize our military readiness  they’d devastate priorities like education and energy and medical research  they would certainly slow our recovery and cost us hundreds of thousands of jobs  that’s why democrats republicans business leaders and economists have already said that these cuts known here in washington as the sequester are a really bad idea .now some in congress have proposed preventing only the defense cuts by making even bigger cuts to things like education and job training medicare and social security benefits  that idea is even worse .to hit the rest of our deficit reduction target we should do what leaders in both parties have already suggested and save hundreds of billions of dollars by getting rid of tax loopholes and deductions for the welloff and the wellconnected  after all why would we choose to make deeper cuts to education and medicare just to protect special interest tax breaks  how is that fair  why is it that deficit reduction is a big emergency justifying making cuts in social security benefits but not closing some loopholes  how does that promote growth .now is our best chance for bipartisan comprehensive tax reform that encourages job creation and helps bring down the deficit     we can get this done  the american people deserve a tax code that helps small businesses spend less time filling out complicated forms and more time expanding and hiring  a tax code that ensures billionaires with highpowered accountants can’t work the system and pay a lower rate than their hardworking secretaries a tax code that lowers incentives to move jobs overseas and lowers tax rates for businesses and manufacturers that are creating jobs right here in the united states of america  that’s what tax reform can deliver  that’s what we can do together .now most of us agree that a plan to reduce the deficit must be part of our agenda  but let’s be clear deficit reduction alone is not an economic plan     a growing economy that creates good middleclass jobs  that must be the north star that guides our efforts     every day we should ask ourselves three questions as a nation  how do we attract more jobs to our shores  how do we equip our people with the skills they need to get those jobs  and how do we make sure that hard work leads to a decent living .a year and a half ago i put forward an american jobs act that independent economists said would create more than 1 million new jobs  and i thank the last congress for passing some of that agenda  i urge this congress to pass the rest     but tonight i’ll lay out additional proposals that are fully paid for and fully consistent with the budget framework both parties agreed to just 18 months ago  let me repeat  nothing i’m proposing tonight should increase our deficit by a single dime  it is not a bigger government we need but a smarter government that sets priorities and invests in broadbased growth     thats what we should be looking for .our first priority is making america a magnet for new jobs and manufacturing  after shedding jobs for more than 10 years our manufacturers have added about 500000 jobs over the past three  caterpillar is bringing jobs back from japan  ford is bringing jobs back from mexico  and this year apple will start making macs in america again .so tonight i’m announcing the launch of three more of these manufacturing hubs where businesses will partner with the department of defense and energy to turn regions left behind by globalization into global centers of hightech jobs  and i ask this congress to help create a network of 15 of these hubs and guarantee that the next revolution in manufacturing is made right here in america  we can get that done .today no area holds more promise than our investments in american energy  after years of talking about it we’re finally poised to control our own energy future  we produce more oil at home than we have in 15 years     we have doubled the distance our cars will go on a gallon of gas and the amount of renewable energy we generate from sources like wind and solar  with tens of thousands of good american jobs to show for it  we produce more natural gas than ever before  and nearly everyone’s energy bill is lower because of it  and over the last four years our emissions of the dangerous carbon pollution that threatens our planet have actually fallen .now the good news is we can make meaningful progress on this issue while driving strong economic growth  i urge this congress to get together pursue a bipartisan marketbased solution to climate change like the one john mccain and joe lieberman worked on together a few years ago  but if congress won’t act soon to protect future generations i will     i will direct my cabinet to come up with executive actions we can take now and in the future to reduce pollution prepare our communities for the consequences of climate change and speed the transition to more sustainable sources of energy .now in the meantime the natural gas boom has led to cleaner power and greater energy independence  we need to encourage that  and that’s why my administration will keep cutting red tape and speeding up new oil and gas permits     that’s got to be part of an alloftheabove plan  but i also want to work with this congress to encourage the research and technology that helps natural gas burn even cleaner and protects our air and our water .in fact much of our newfound energy is drawn from lands and waters that we the public own together  so tonight i propose we use some of our oil and gas revenues to fund an energy security trust that will drive new research and technology to shift our cars and trucks off oil for good  if a nonpartisan coalition of ceos and retired generals and admirals can get behind this idea then so can we  let’s take their advice and free our families and businesses from the painful spikes in gas prices we’ve put up with for far too long .i’m also issuing a new goal for america  let’s cut in half the energy wasted by our homes and businesses over the next 20 years     well work with the states to do it  those states with the best ideas to create jobs and lower energy bills by constructing more efficient buildings will receive federal support to help make that happen .america’s energy sector is just one part of an aging infrastructure badly in need of repair  ask any ceo where they’d rather locate and hire  a country with deteriorating roads and bridges or one with highspeed rail and internet hightech schools selfhealing power grids  the ceo of siemens america  a company that brought hundreds of new jobs to north carolina  said that if we upgrade our infrastructure they’ll bring even more jobs  and that’s the attitude of a lot of companies all around the world  and i know you want these jobcreating projects in your district  i’ve seen all those ribboncuttings laughter .these initiatives in manufacturing energy infrastructure housing  all these things will help entrepreneurs and small business owners expand and create new jobs  but none of it will matter unless we also equip our citizens with the skills and training to fill those jobs .and that has to start at the earliest possible age  study after study shows that the sooner a child begins learning the better he or she does down the road  but today fewer than 3 in 10 four yearolds are enrolled in a highquality preschool program  most middleclass parents can’t afford a few hundred bucks a week for a private preschool  and for poor kids who need help the most this lack of access to preschool education can shadow them for the rest of their lives  so tonight i propose working with states to make highquality preschool available to every single child in america     thats something we should be able to do .and four years ago we started race to the top  a competition that convinced almost every state to develop smarter curricula and higher standards all for about 1 percent of what we spend on education each year  tonight i’m announcing a new challenge to redesign america’s high schools so they better equip graduates for the demands of a hightech economy  and we’ll reward schools that develop new partnerships with colleges and employers and create classes that focus on science technology engineering and math  the skills today’s employers are looking for to fill the jobs that are there right now and will be there in the future .now even with better high schools most young people will need some higher education  it’s a simple fact the more education you’ve got the more likely you are to have a good job and work your way into the middle class  but today skyrocketing costs price too many young people out of a higher education or saddle them with unsustainable debt .through tax credits grants and better loans we’ve made college more affordable for millions of students and families over the last few years  but taxpayers can’t keep on subsidizing higher and higher and higher costs for higher education  colleges must do their part to keep costs down and it’s our job to make sure that they do .so tonight i ask congress to change the higher education act so that affordability and value are included in determining which colleges receive certain types of federal aid    and tomorrow my administration will release a new “college scorecard” that parents and students can use to compare schools based on a simple criteria  where you can get the most bang for your educational buck .now to grow our middle class our citizens have to have access to the education and training that today’s jobs require  but we also have to make sure that america remains a place where everyone who’s willing to work  everybody who’s willing to work hard has the chance to get ahead .and real reform means fixing the legal immigration system to cut waiting periods and attract the highlyskilled entrepreneurs and engineers that will help create jobs and grow our economy .we know our economy is stronger when we reward an honest day’s work with honest wages  but today a fulltime worker making the minimum wage earns 14500 a year  even with the tax relief we put in place a family with two kids that earns the minimum wage still lives below the poverty line  that’s wrong  that’s why since the last time this congress raised the minimum wage 19 states have chosen to bump theirs even higher .today the organization that attacked us on 911 is a shadow of its former self     its true different al qaeda affiliates and extremist groups have emerged  from the arabian peninsula to africa  the threat these groups pose is evolving  but to meet this threat we don’t need to send tens of thousands of our sons and daughters abroad or occupy other nations  instead well need to help countries like yemen and libya and somalia provide for their own security and help allies who take the fight to terrorists as we have in mali  and where necessary through a range of capabilities we will continue to take direct action against those terrorists who pose the gravest threat to americans .and that’s why earlier today i signed a new executive order that will strengthen our cyber defenses by increasing information sharing and developing standards to protect our national security our jobs and our privacy .well invest in new capabilities even as we reduce waste and wartime spending  we will ensure equal treatment for all servicemembers and equal benefits for their families  gay and straight     we will draw upon the courage and skills of our sisters and daughters and moms because women have proven under fire that they are ready for combat .but tonight we turn the page  tonight after a breakthrough year for america our economy is growing and creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999     our unemployment rate is now lower than it was before the financial crisis  more of our kids are graduating than ever before  more of our people are insured than ever before     and we are as free from the grip of foreign oil as we’ve been in almost 30 years .will we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well  or will we commit ourselves to an economy that generates rising incomes and chances for everyone who makes the effort .we believed we could reverse the tide of outsourcing and draw new jobs to our shores  and over the past five years our businesses have created more than 11 million new jobs .we believed we could reduce our dependence on foreign oil and protect our planet  and today america is number one in oil and gas  america is number one in wind power  every three weeks we bring online as much solar power as we did in all of 2008    and thanks to lower gas prices and higher fuel standards the typical family this year should save about 750 at the pump .because families like rebekah’s still need our help  she and ben are working as hard as ever but they’ve had to forego vacations and a new car so that they can pay off student loans and save for retirement  friday night pizza that’s a big splurge  basic childcare for jack and henry costs more than their mortgage and almost as much as a year at the university of minnesota  like millions of hardworking americans rebekah isn’t asking for a handout but she is asking that we look for more ways to help families get ahead .and in fact at every moment of economic change throughout our history this country has taken bold action to adapt to new circumstances and to make sure everyone gets a fair shot  we set up worker protections social security medicare medicaid to protect ourselves from the harshest adversity  we gave our citizens schools and colleges infrastructure and the internet  tools they needed to go as far as their effort and their dreams will take them .here’s one example  during world war ii when men like my grandfather went off to war having women like my grandmother in the workforce was a national security priority  so this country provided universal childcare  in today’s economy when having both parents in the workforce is an economic necessity for many families we need affordable highquality childcare more than ever .it’s not a nicetohave  it’s a musthave  so it’s time we stop treating childcare as a side issue or as a women’s issue and treat it like the national economic priority that it is for all of us     and that’s why my plan will make quality childcare more available and more affordable for every middleclass and lowincome family with young children in america  by creating more slots and a new tax cut of up to 3000 per child per year .now these ideas won’t make everybody rich won’t relieve every hardship  that’s not the job of government  to give working families a fair shot we still need more employers to see beyond next quarter’s earnings and recognize that investing in their workforce is in their company’s longterm interest  we still need laws that strengthen rather than weaken unions and give american workers a voice .but starting in the late ‘70s this social compact began to unravel  technology made it easier for companies to do more with less eliminating certain job occupations  a more competitive world lets companies ship jobs anywhere  and as good manufacturing jobs automated or headed offshore workers lost their leverage jobs paid less and offered fewer benefits .and the result is an economy that’s become profoundly unequal and families that are more insecure  i’ll just give you a few statistics  since 1979 when i graduated from high school our productivity is up by more than 90 percent but the income of the typical family has increased by less than eight percent  since 1979 our economy has more than doubled in size but most of that growth has flowed to a fortunate few .the top 10 percent no longer takes in onethird of our income  it now takes half  whereas in the past the average ceo made about 20 to 30 times the income of the average worker today’s ceo now makes 273 times more  and meanwhile a family in the top 1 percent has a net worth 288 times higher than the typical family which is a record for this country .but this increasing inequality is most pronounced in our country and it challenges the very essence of who we are as a people  understand we’ve never begrudged success in america  we aspire to it  we admire folks who start new businesses create jobs and invent the products that enrich our lives  and we expect them to be rewarded handsomely for it  in fact weve often accepted more income inequality than many other nations for one big reason  because we were convinced that america is a place where even if you’re born with nothing with a little hard work you can improve your own situation over time and build something better to leave your kids  as lincoln once said “while we do not propose any war upon capital we do wish to allow the humblest man an equal chance to get rich with everybody else” .second we need to dispel the myth that the goals of growing the economy and reducing inequality are necessarily in conflict when they should actually work in concert  we know from our history that our economy grows best from the middle out when growth is more widely shared  and we know that beyond a certain level of inequality growth actually slows altogether .third we need to set aside the belief that government cannot do anything about reducing inequality  it’s true that government cannot prevent all the downsides of the technological change and global competition that are out there right now and some of those forces are also some of the things that are helping us grow  and it’s also true that some programs in the past like welfare before it was reformed were sometimes poorly designed created disincentives to work .without social security nearly half of seniors would be living in poverty  half  today fewer than 1 in 10 do  before medicare only half of all seniors had some form of health insurance  today virtually all do  and because we’ve strengthened that safety net and expanded prowork and profamily tax credits like the earned income tax credit a recent study found that the poverty rate has fallen by 40 percent since the 1960s  and these endeavors didn’t just make us a better country they reaffirmed that we are a great country .to begin with we have to continue to relentlessly push a growth agenda  it may be true that in today’s economy growth alone does not guarantee higher wages and incomes  weve seen that  but whats also true is we can’t tackle inequality if the economic pie is shrinking or stagnant  the fact is if you’re a progressive and you want to help the middle class and the working poor you’ve still got to be concerned about competitiveness and productivity and business confidence that spurs private sector investment .and that’s why from day one we’ve worked to get the economy growing and help our businesses hire  and thanks to their resilience and innovation they’ve created nearly 8 million new jobs over the past 44 months  and now we’ve got to grow the economy even faster  and weve got to keep working to make america a magnet for good middleclass jobs to replace the ones that we’ve lost in recent decades  jobs in manufacturing and energy and infrastructure and technology .and that means simplifying our corporate tax code in a way that closes wasteful loopholes and ends incentives to ship jobs overseas     and by broadening the base we can actually lower rates to encourage more companies to hire here and use some of the money we save to create good jobs rebuilding our roads and our bridges and our airports and all the infrastructure our businesses need .it means a trade agenda that grows exports and works for the middle class  it means streamlining regulations that are outdated or unnecessary or too costly  and it means coming together around a responsible budget  one that grows our economy faster right now and shrinks our longterm deficits one that unwinds the harmful sequester cuts that havent made a lot of sense     and then frees up resources to invest in things like the scientific research thats always unleashed new innovation and new industries .when it comes to our budget we should not be stuck in a stale debate from two years ago or three years ago  a relentlessly growing deficit of opportunity is a bigger threat to our future than our rapidly shrinking fiscal deficit .so that’s step one towards restoring mobility  making sure our economy is growing faster  step two is making sure we empower more americans with the skills and education they need to compete in a highly competitive global economy .we know that education is the most important predictor of income today so we launched a race to the top in our schools  we’re supporting states that have raised standards for teaching and learning  we’re pushing for redesigned high schools that graduate more kids with the technical training and apprenticeships and indemand hightech skills that can lead directly to a good job and a middleclass life .we know it’s harder to find a job today without some higher education so we’ve helped more students go to college with grants and loans that go farther than before  we’ve made it more practical to repay those loans  and today more students are graduating from college than ever before  we’re also pursuing an aggressive strategy to promote innovation that reins in tuition costs  we’ve got lower costs so that young people are not burdened by enormous debt when they make the right decision to get higher education  and next week michelle and i will bring together college presidents and nonprofits to lead a campaign to help more lowincome students attend and succeed in college .but while higher education may be the surest path to the middle class it’s not the only one  so we should offer our people the best technical education in the world  that’s why we’ve worked to connect local businesses with community colleges so that workers young and old can earn the new skills that earn them more money .and i’ve also embraced an idea that i know all of you at the center for american progress have championed  and by the way republican governors in a couple of states have championed  and that’s making highquality preschool available to every child in america     we know that kids in these programs grow up likelier to get more education earn higher wages form more stable families of their own  it starts a virtuous cycle not a vicious one  and we should invest in that  we should give all of our children that chance .now we all know the arguments that have been used against a higher minimum wage  some say it actually hurts lowwage workers  businesses will be less likely to hire them  but there’s no solid evidence that a higher minimum wage costs jobs and research shows it raises incomes for lowwage workers and boosts shortterm economic growth .number four as i alluded to earlier we still need targeted programs for the communities and workers that have been hit hardest by economic change and the great recession  these communities are no longer limited to the inner city  they’re found in neighborhoods hammered by the housing crisis manufacturing towns hit hard by years of plants packing up landlocked rural areas where young folks oftentimes feel like theyve got to leave just to find a job  there are communities that just aren’t generating enough jobs anymore .the point is these programs are not typically hammocks for people to just lie back and relax  these programs are almost always temporary means for hardworking people to stay afloat while they try to find a new job or go into school to retrain themselves for the jobs that are out there or sometimes just to cope with a bout of bad luck  progressives should be open to reforms that actually strengthen these programs and make them more responsive to a 21st century economy  for example we should be willing to look at fresh ideas to revamp unemployment and disability programs to encourage faster and higher rates of reemployment without cutting benefits  we shouldnt weaken fundamental protections built over generations because given the constant churn in today’s economy and the disabilities that many of our friends and neighbors live with theyre needed more than ever  we should strengthen them and adapt them to new circumstances so they work even better .look i’ve never believed that government can solve every problem or should  and neither do you  we know that ultimately our strength is grounded in our people  individuals out there striving working making things happen  it depends on community a rich and generous sense of community  that’s at the core of what happens at thearc here every day  you understand that turning back rising inequality and expanding opportunity requires parents taking responsibility for their kids kids taking responsibility to work hard  it requires religious leaders who mobilize their congregations to rebuild neighborhoods block by block requires civic organizations that can help train the unemployed link them with businesses for the jobs of the future  it requires companies and ceos to set an example by providing decent wages and salaries and benefits for their workers and a shot for somebody who is down on his or her luck  we know that’s our strength  our people our communities our businesses .we did that in december  thanks to the tax cuts we passed americans’ paychecks are a little bigger today  every business can write off the full cost of new investments that they make this year  and these steps taken by democrats and republicans will grow the economy and add to the more than one million private sector jobs created last year .but we have to do more  these steps we’ve taken over the last two years may have broken the back of this recession but to win the future we’ll need to take on challenges that have been decades in the making .and now it’s our turn  we know what it takes to compete for the jobs and industries of our time  we need to outinnovate outeducate and outbuild the rest of the world     we have to make america the best place on earth to do business  we need to take responsibility for our deficit and reform our government  that’s how our people will prosper  that’s how we’ll win the future     and tonight i’d like to talk about how we get there .the first step in winning the future is encouraging american innovation  none of us can predict with certainty what the next big industry will be or where the new jobs will come from  thirty years ago we couldn’t know that something called the internet would lead to an economic revolution  what we can do  what america does better than anyone else  is spark the creativity and imagination of our people  we’re the nation that put cars in driveways and computers in offices the nation of edison and the wright brothers of google and facebook  in america innovation doesn’t just change our lives  it is how we make our living .half a century ago when the soviets beat us into space with the launch of a satellite called sputnik we had no idea how we would beat them to the moon  the science wasn’t even there yet  nasa didn’t exist  but after investing in better research and education we didn’t just surpass the soviets we unleashed a wave of innovation that created new industries and millions of new jobs .this is our generation’s sputnik moment  two years ago i said that we needed to reach a level of research and development we haven’t seen since the height of the space race  and in a few weeks i will be sending a budget to congress that helps us meet that goal  we’ll invest in biomedical research information technology and especially clean energy technology –    an investment that will strengthen our security protect our planet and create countless new jobs for our people .already we’re seeing the promise of renewable energy  robert and gary allen are brothers who run a small michigan roofing company  after september 11th they volunteered their best roofers to help repair the pentagon  but half of their factory went unused and the recession hit them hard  today with the help of a government loan that empty space is being used to manufacture solar shingles that are being sold all across the country  in robert’s words “we reinvented ourselves” .that’s what americans have done for over 200 years reinvented ourselves  and to spur on more success stories like the allen brothers we’ve begun to reinvent our energy policy we’re not just handing out money  we’re issuing a challenge  we’re telling america’s scientists and engineers that if they assemble teams of the best minds in their fields and focus on the hardest problems in clean energy we’ll fund the apollo projects of our time .at the california institute of technology they’re developing a way to turn sunlight and water into fuel for our cars  at oak ridge national laboratory they’re using supercomputers to get a lot more power out of our nuclear facilities  with more research and incentives we can break our dependence on oil with biofuels and become the first country to have a million electric vehicles on the road by 2015 .now clean energy breakthroughs will only translate into clean energy jobs if businesses know there will be a market for what they’re selling  so tonight i challenge you to join me in setting a new goal  by 2035 80 percent of america’s electricity will come from clean energy sources .think about it  over the next 10 years nearly half of all new jobs will require education that goes beyond a high school education  and yet as many as a quarter of our students aren’t even finishing high school  the quality of our math and science education lags behind many other nations  america has fallen to ninth in the proportion of young people with a college degree  and so the question is whether all of us – as citizens and as parents – are willing to do what’s necessary to give every child a chance to succeed .that responsibility begins not in our classrooms but in our homes and communities  it’s family that first instills the love of learning in a child  only parents can make sure the tv is turned off and homework gets done  we need to teach our kids that it’s not just the winner of the super bowl who deserves to be celebrated but the winner of the science fair     we need to teach them that success is not a function of fame or pr but of hard work and discipline .our schools share this responsibility  when a child walks into a classroom it should be a place of high expectations and high performance  but too many schools don’t meet this test that’s why instead of just pouring money into a system that’s not working we launched a competition called race to the top  to all 50 states we said “if you show us the most innovative plans to improve teacher quality and student achievement we’ll show you the money” .of course the education race doesn’t end with a high school diploma  to compete higher education must be within the reach of every american     that’s why we’ve ended the unwarranted taxpayer subsidies that went to banks and used the savings to make college affordable for millions of students     and this year i ask congress to go further and make permanent our tuition tax credit – worth 10000 for four years of college  it’s the right thing to do .because people need to be able to train for new jobs and careers in today’s fastchanging economy we’re also revitalizing america’s community colleges  last month i saw the promise of these schools at forsyth tech in north carolina  many of the students there used to work in the surrounding factories that have since left town  one mother of two a woman named kathy proctor had worked in the furniture industry since she was 18 years old  and she told me she’s earning her degree in biotechnology now at 55 years old not just because the furniture jobs are gone but because she wants to inspire her children to pursue their dreams too  as kathy said “i hope it tells them to never give up” .if we take these steps – if we raise expectations for every child and give them the best possible chance at an education from the day they are born until the last job they take – we will reach the goal that i set two years ago  by the end of the decade america will once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world .the third step in winning the future is rebuilding america  to attract new businesses to our shores we need the fastest most reliable ways to move people goods and information  from highspeed rail to highspeed internet .we have to do better  america is the nation that built the transcontinental railroad brought electricity to rural communities constructed the interstate highway system  the jobs created by these projects didn’t just come from laying down track or pavement  they came from businesses that opened near a town’s new train station or the new offramp .so over the last two years we’ve begun rebuilding for the 21st century a project that has meant thousands of good jobs for the hardhit construction industry  and tonight i’m proposing that we redouble those efforts .all these investments – in innovation education and infrastructure – will make america a better place to do business and create jobs  but to help our companies compete we also have to knock down barriers that stand in the way of their success .for example over the years a parade of lobbyists has rigged the tax code to benefit particular companies and industries  those with accountants or lawyers to work the system can end up paying no taxes at all  but all the rest are hit with one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world  it makes no sense and it has to change .so tonight i’m asking democrats and republicans to simplify the system  get rid of the loopholes  level the playing field  and use the savings to lower the corporate tax rate for the first time in 25 years – without adding to our deficit  it can be done .we are living with a legacy of deficit spending that began almost a decade ago  and in the wake of the financial crisis some of that was necessary to keep credit flowing save jobs and put money in people’s pockets .so tonight i am proposing that starting this year we freeze annual domestic spending for the next five years     now this would reduce the deficit by more than 400 billion over the next decade and will bring discretionary spending to the lowest share of our economy since dwight eisenhower was president .now most of the cuts and savings i’ve proposed only address annual domestic spending which represents a little more than 12 percent of our budget  to make further progress we have to stop pretending that cutting this kind of spending alone will be enough  it won’t .and if we truly care about our deficit we simply can’t afford a permanent extension of the tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent of americans     before we take money away from our schools or scholarships away from our students we should ask millionaires to give up their tax break  it’s not a matter of punishing their success  it’s about promoting america’s success .now we’ve made great strides over the last two years in using technology and getting rid of waste  veterans can now download their electronic medical records with a click of the mouse  we’re selling acres of federal office space that hasn’t been used in years and we’ll cut through red tape to get rid of more  but we need to think bigger  in the coming months my administration will develop a proposal to merge consolidate and reorganize the federal government in a way that best serves the goal of a more competitive america  i will submit that proposal to congress for a vote – and we will push to get it passed .we should have no illusions about the work ahead of us reforming our schools changing the way we use energy reducing our deficit – none of this will be easy  all of it will take time  and it will be harder because we will argue about everything  the costs  the details  the letter of every law .brandon started a company in berlin pennsylvania that specializes in a new kind of drilling technology  and one day last summer he saw the news that halfway across the world 33 men were trapped in a chilean mine and no one knew how to save them .but brandon thought his company could help  and so he designed a rescue that would come to be known as plan b  his employees worked around the clock to manufacture the necessary drilling equipment  and brandon left for chile .i’m not suggesting this will be easy  i won’t pretend that we will be able to bridge every difference or solve every disagreement  there’s a reason we have two parties in this country and both democrats and republicans have certain beliefs and certain principles that each feels cannot be compromised  but what i think the american people are expecting and what we owe them is to focus on those issues that affect their jobs their security and their future  reducing our deficit promoting a clean energy economy making sure that our children are the best educated in the world making sure that we’re making the investments in technology that will allow us to keep our competitive edge in the global economy .and thats something that we all need to remember right now and in the coming months  and if we do i have no doubt that we will continue this nation’s long journey towards a better future .and so in these budget discussions the key is to be able to distinguish between stuff that isn’t adding to our growth isn’t an investment in our future and those things that are absolutely necessary for us to be able to increase job growth in the future as well .so there are some things that we can do right now that will help sustain the recovery and advance it even as we’re also sitting down and figuring out okay over the next several years what kinds of budget cuts can we make that are intelligent that are smart that won’t be undermining our recovery but in fact will be encouraging job growth .with respect to the tax cut issue my goal is to make sure that we don’t have a huge spike in taxes for middleclass families  not only would that be a terrible burden on families who are already going through tough times it would be bad for our economy  it is very important that we’re not taking a whole bunch of money out of the system from people who are most likely to spend that money on goods services groceries buying a new winter coat for the kids .so my goal is to sit down with speakerelect boehner and mitch mcconnell and harry and nancy sometime in the next few weeks and see where we can move forward in a way that first of all does no harm that extends those tax cuts that are very important for middleclass families also extends those provisions that are important to encourage businesses to invest and provide businesses some certainty over the next year or two .the epa is under a court order that says greenhouse gases are a pollutant that fall under their jurisdiction and i think one of the things thats very important for me is not to have us ignore the science but rather to find ways that we can solve these problems that don’t hurt the economy that encourage the development of clean energy in this country that in fact may give us opportunities to create entire new industries and create jobs that  and that put us in a competitive posture around the world .it will not be easy not just because democrats and republicans may have different priorities as we were just discussing when it came to how we structure tax cuts but because these issues are hard .we have such good and decent people who on a daytoday basis are finding all kinds of ways to live together and educate kids and grow their communities and improve their communities and create businesses and work together to create great new products and services  the american people always make me optimistic .but we caught up very quick president eisenhower signed legislation to create nasa and to invest in science and math education from grade school to graduate school in 1961 president kennedy boldly declared before a joint session of congress that the united states would send a man to the moon and return him safely to the earth within the decade and as a nation we set about meeting that goal reaping rewards that have in the decades since touched every facet of our lives nasa was at the forefront many gave their careers to the effort and some have given far more .so today i’d like to talk about the next chapter in this story the challenges facing our space program are different and our imperatives for this program are different than in decades past we’re no longer racing against an adversary we’re no longer competing to achieve a singular goal like reaching the moon in fact what was once a global competition has long since become a global collaboration but while the measure of our achievements has changed a great deal over the past 50 years what we do  or fail to do  in seeking new frontiers is no less consequential for our future in space and here on earth .i know there have been a number of questions raised about my administration’s plan for space exploration especially in this part of florida where so many rely on nasa as a source of income as well as a source of pride and community and these questions come at a time of transition as the space shuttle nears its scheduled retirement after almost 30 years of service and understandably this adds to the worries of folks concerned not only about their own futures but about the future of the space program to which they’ve devoted their lives .but we can also see it in other ways in the reluctance of those who hold office to set clear achievable objectives to provide the resources to meet those objectives and to justify not just these plans but the larger purpose of space exploration in the 21st century .so nasa from the start several months ago when i issued my budget was one of the areas where we didn’t just maintain a freeze but we actually increased funding by 6 billion by doing that we will ramp up robotic exploration of the solar system including a probe of the sun’s atmosphere new scouting missions to mars and other destinations and an advanced telescope to follow hubble allowing us to peer deeper into the universe than ever before .we will increase earthbased observation to improve our understanding of our climate and our world  science that will garner tangible benefits helping us to protect our environment for future generations .and we will extend the life of the international space station likely by more than five years while actually using it for its intended purpose conducting advanced research that can help improve the daily lives of people here on earth as well as testing and improving upon our capabilities in space this includes technologies like more efficient life support systems that will help reduce the cost of future missions and in order to reach the space station we will work with a growing array of private companies competing to make getting to space easier and more affordable .at the same time after decades of neglect we will increase investment  right away  in other groundbreaking technologies that will allow astronauts to reach space sooner and more often to travel farther and faster for less cost and to live and work in space for longer periods of time more safely that means tackling major scientific and technological challenges how do we shield astronauts from radiation on longer missions how do we harness resources on distant worlds how do we supply spacecraft with energy needed for these farreaching journeys these are questions that we can answer and will answer and these are the questions whose answers no doubt will reap untold benefits right here on earth .some have said for instance that this plan gives up our leadership in space by failing to produce plans within nasa to reach low earth orbit instead of relying on companies and other countries but we will actually reach space faster and more often under this new plan in ways that will help us improve our technological capacity and lower our costs which are both essential for the longterm sustainability of space flight in fact through our plan we’ll be sending many more astronauts to space over the next decade .there are also those who criticized our decision to end parts of constellation as one that will hinder space exploration below sic low earth orbit but it’s precisely by investing in groundbreaking research and innovative companies that we will have the potential to rapidly transform our capabilities  even as we build on the important work already completed through projects like orion for future missions and unlike the previous program we are setting a course with specific and achievable milestones .we’re going to modernize the kennedy space center creating jobs as we upgrade launch facilities and there’s potential for even more jobs as companies in florida and across america compete to be part of a new space transportation industry and some of those industry leaders are here today this holds the promise of generating more than 10000 jobs nationwide over the next few years and many of these jobs will be created right here in florida because this is an area primed to lead in this competition .now it’s true  there are floridians who will see their work on the shuttle end as the program winds down this is based on a decision that was made six years ago not six months ago but that doesn’t make it any less painful for families and communities affected as this decision becomes reality .so i’m proposing  in part because of strong lobbying by bill and by suzanne as well as charlie  i’m proposing a 40 million initiative led by a highlevel team from the white house nasa and other agencies to develop a plan for regional economic growth and job creation and i expect this plan to reach my desk by august 15th   it’s an effort that will help prepare this already skilled workforce for new opportunities in the space industry and beyond .now i’ll close by saying this i know that some americans have asked a question that’s particularly apt on tax day why spend money on nasa at all why spend money solving problems in space when we don’t lack for problems to solve here on the ground and obviously our country is still reeling from the worst economic turmoil we’ve known in generations we have massive structural deficits that have to be closed in the coming years .but you and i know this is a false choice we have to fix our economy we need to close our deficits but for pennies on the dollar the space program has fueled jobs and entire industries for pennies on the dollar the space program has improved our lives advanced our society strengthened our economy and inspired generations of americans and i have no doubt that nasa can continue to fulfill this role   but that is why  but i want to say clearly to those of you who work for nasa but to the entire community that has been so supportive of the space program in this area that is exactly why it’s so essential that we pursue a new course and that we revitalize nasa and its mission  not just with dollars but with clear aims and a larger purpose .over the next 2 years this plan will save or create 35 million jobs more than 90 percent of these jobs will be in the private sector jobs rebuilding our roads and bridges constructing wind turbines and solar panels laying broadband and expanding mass transit .so the recovery plan we passed is the first step in getting our economy back on track but it is just the first step because even if we manage this plan flawlessly there will be no real recovery unless we clean up the credit crisis that has severely weakened our financial system .first we are creating a new lending fund that represents the largest effort ever to help provide auto loans college loans and smallbusiness loans to the consumers and entrepreneurs who keep this economy running .third we will act with the full force of the federal government to ensure that the major banks that americans depend on have enough confidence and enough money to lend even in more difficult times and when we learn that a major bank has serious problems we will hold accountable those responsible force the necessary adjustments provide the support to clean up their balance sheets and assure the continuity of a strong viable institution that can serve our people and our economy .so i ask this congress to join me in doing whatever proves necessary because we cannot consign our nation to an openended recession and to ensure that a crisis of this magnitude never happens again i ask congress to move quickly on legislation that will finally reform our outdated regulatory system it is time to put in place tough new commonsense rules of the road so that our financial market rewards drive and innovation and punishes shortcuts and abuse .in the next few days i will submit a budget to congress so often weve come to view these documents as simply numbers on a page or a laundry list of programs i see this document differently i see it as a vision for america as a blueprint for our future .my budget does not attempt to solve every problem or address every issue it reflects the stark reality of what weve inherited a trilliondollar deficit a financial crisis and a costly recession given these realities everyone in this chamber democrats and republicans will have to sacrifice some worthy priorities for which there are no dollars and that includes me but that does not mean we can afford to ignore our longterm challenges i reject the view that says our problems will simply take care of themselves that says government has no role in laying the foundation for our common prosperity .it begins with energy we know the country that harnesses the power of clean renewable energy will lead the 21st century and yet it is china that has launched the largest effort in history to make their economy energyefficient we invented solar technology but weve fallen behind countries like germany and japan in producing it new plugin hybrids roll off our assembly lines but they will run on batteries made in korea well i do not accept a future where the jobs and industries of tomorrow take root beyond our borders and i know you dont either it is time for america to lead again .thanks to our recovery plan we will double this nations supply of renewable energy in the next 3 years weve also made the largest investment in basic research funding in american history an investment that will spur not only new discoveries in energy but breakthroughs in medicine and science and technology .we will soon lay down thousands of miles of power lines that can carry new energy to cities and towns across this country and we will put americans to work making our homes and buildings more efficient so that we can save billions of dollars on our energy bills .but to truly transform our economy to protect our security and save our planet from the ravages of climate change we need to ultimately make clean renewable energy the profitable kind of energy so i ask this congress to send me legislation that places a marketbased cap on carbon pollution and drives the production of more renewable energy in america thats what we need and to support that innovation we will invest 15 billion a year to develop technologies like wind power and solar power advanced biofuels clean coal and more efficient cars and trucks built right here in america .the third challenge we must address is the urgent need to expand the promise of education in america in a global economy where the most valuable skill you can sell is your knowledge a good education is no longer just a pathway to opportunity it is a prerequisite right now threequarters of the fastest growing occupations require more than a high school diploma and yet just over half of our citizens have that level of education we have one of the highest high school dropout rates of any industrialized nation and half of the students who begin college never finish .already weve made historic investment in education through the economic recovery plan weve dramatically expanded early childhood education and will continue to improve its quality because we know that the most formative learning comes in those first years of life weve made college affordable for nearly 7 million more students—7 million and we have provided the resources necessary to prevent painful cuts and teacher layoffs that would set back our childrens progress .but we know that our schools dont just need more resources they need more reform and that is why this budget creates new teachers—new incentives for teacher performance pathways for advancement and rewards for success well invest in innovative programs that are already helping schools meet high standards and close achievement gaps and we will expand our commitment to charter schools .it is our responsibility as lawmakers and as educators to make this system work but it is the responsibility of every citizen to participate in it so tonight i ask every american to commit to at least 1 year or more of higher education or career training this can be community college or a 4year school vocational training or an apprenticeship but whatever the training may be every american will need to get more than a high school diploma .there is of course another responsibility we have to our children and thats the responsibility to ensure that we do not pass on to them a debt they cannot pay that is critical applause i agree absolutely see i know we can get some consensus in here laughter with the deficit we inherited the cost of the crisis we face and the longterm challenges we must meet it has never been more important to ensure that as our economy recovers we do what it takes to bring this deficit down that is critical .and yesterday i held a fiscal summit where i pledged to cut the deficit in half by the end of my first term in office my administration has also begun to go line by line through the federal budget in order to eliminate wasteful and ineffective programs as you can imagine this is a process that will take some time but we have already identified 2 trillion in savings over the next decade .in this budget we will end education programs that dont work and end direct payments to large agribusiness that dont need them well eliminate the nobid contracts that have wasted billions in iraq and reform our defense budget so that were not paying for cold warera weapons systems we dont use we will root out the waste and fraud and abuse in our medicare program that doesnt make our seniors any healthier we will restore a sense of fairness and balance to our tax code by finally ending the tax breaks for corporations that ship our jobs overseas .in order to save our children from a future of debt we will also end the tax breaks for the wealthiest 2 percent of americans now let me be clear—let me be absolutely clear because i know youll end up hearing some of the same claims that rolling back these tax breaks means a massive tax increase on the american people if your family earns less than 250000 a year a quarter million dollars a year you will not see your taxes increased a single dime i repeat not one single dime in fact—not a dime—in fact the recovery plan provides a tax cut—thats right a tax cut—for 95 percent of working families and by the way these checks are on the way .finally because were also suffering from a deficit of trust i am committed to restoring a sense of honesty and accountability to our budget that is why this budget looks ahead 10 years and accounts for spending that was left out under the old rules and for the first time that includes the full cost of fighting in iraq and afghanistan for 7 years we have been a nation at war no longer will we hide its price .i think about greensburg kansas a town that was completely destroyed by a tornado but is being rebuilt by its residents as a global example of how clean energy can power an entire community how it can bring jobs and businesses to a place where piles of bricks and rubble once lay the tragedy was terrible said one of the men who helped them rebuild but the folks here know that it also provided an incredible opportunity .with the support of family friends and teachers sonia earned scholarships to princeton where she graduated at the top of her class and yale law school where she was an editor of the yale law journal stepping onto the path that led her here today .now i dont want to pretend that today marks the end of our economic problems  nor does it constitute all of what were going to have to do to turn our economy around  but today does mark the beginning of the end  the beginning of what we need to do to create jobs for americans scrambling in the wake of layoffs the beginning of what we need to do to provide relief for families worried they wont be able to pay next months bills the beginning of the first steps to set our economy on a firmer foundation paving the way to longterm growth and prosperity .because we know america cant outcompete the world tomorrow if our children are being outeducated today were making the largest investment in education in our nations history     its an investment that will create jobs building 21st century classrooms and libraries and labs for millions of children across america  it will provide funds to train a new generation of math and science teachers while giving aid to states and school districts to stop teachers from being laid off and education programs from being cut .because we know we cant power americas future on energy thats controlled by foreign dictators we are taking big steps down the road to energy independence laying the groundwork for new green energy economies that can create countless wellpaying jobs  its an investment that will double the amount of renewable energy produced over the next three years  think about that  double the amount of renewable energy in three years     provide tax credits and loan guarantees to companies like namaste a company that will be expanding instead of laying people off as a result of the plan that im about to sign .and in the process we will transform the way we use energy today the electricity we use is carried along a grid of lines and wires that date back to thomas edison  a grid that cant support the demands of this economy  this means were using 19th and 20th century technologies to battle 21st century problems like climate change and energy security  it also means that places like north dakota can  that can produce a lot of wind energy cant deliver it to communities that want it leading to a gap between how much clean energy we are using and how much we could be using .the investment were making today will create a newer smarter electric grid that will allow for broader use of alternative energy  we will build on the work thats being done in places like boulder  a community thats on its  thats on pace to be the worlds first smart grid city     this investment will place smart meters in homes to make our energy bills lower make outages less likely and make it easier to use clean energy  its an investment that will save taxpayers over 1 billion by slashing energy costs in our federal buildings by 25 percent save working families hundreds of dollars a year on their energy bills by weatherizing over 1 million homes  and its an investment that takes the important first step towards a national transmission superhighway that will connect our cities to the windy plains of the dakotas and the sunny deserts of the southwest .even beyond energy from the national institutes of health to the national science foundation this recovery act represents the biggest increase in basic research funding in the long history of americas noble endeavor to better understand our world  and just as president kennedy sparked an explosion of innovation when he set americas sights on the moon i hope this investment will ignite our imagination once more spurring new discoveries and breakthroughs in science in medicine in energy to make our economy stronger and our nation more secure and our planet safer for our children .now while this package is composed mostly of critical investments it also includes aid to state and local governments to prevent layoffs of firefighters or police recruits in     recruits like the ones in columbus ohio who were told that instead of being sworn in as officers they were about to be let go  it includes help for those hardest hit by our economic crisis like the nearly 18 million americans who will get larger unemployment checks in the mail  about a third of this package comes in the forms of tax cuts  by the way the most progressive in our history     not only spurring job creation but putting money in the pockets of 95 percent of hardworking families in america     so unlike the tax cuts that weve seen in recent years the vast majority of these tax benefits will go not to the wealthiest americans but to the middle class     with those workers who make the least benefiting the most .what im signing then is a balanced plan with a mix of tax cuts and investments  its a plan thats been put together without earmarks or the usual pork barrel spending  its a plan that will be implemented with an unprecedented level of transparency and accountability .now as important as the step we take today is this legislation represents only the first part of the broad strategy we need to address our economic crisis  in the coming days and weeks ill be launching other aspects of the plan  we will need to stabilize repair and reform our banking system and get credit flowing again to families and businesses  we will need to end the culture where we ignore problems until they become fullblown crises instead of recognizing that the only way to build a thriving economy is to set and enforce firm rules of the road .we must stem the spread of foreclosures and falling home values for all americans and do everything we can to help responsible homeowners stay in their homes  something ill talk more about tomorrow  and we will need to do everything in the short term to get our economy moving again while at the same time recognizing that we have inherited a trilliondollar deficit and we need to begin restoring fiscal discipline and taming our exploding deficits over the long term .for everywhere we look there is work to be done the state of the economy calls for action bold and swift and we will act—not only to create new jobs but to lay a new foundation for growth we will build the roads and bridges the electric grids and digital lines that feed our commerce and bind us together we will restore science to its rightful place and wield technologys wonders to raise health cares quality and lower its cost we will harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories and we will transform our schools and colleges and universities to meet the demands of a new age all this we can do and all this we will do .for as much as government can do and must do it is ultimately the faith and determination of the american people upon which this nation relies it is the kindness to take in a stranger when the levees break the selflessness of workers who would rather cut their hours than see a friend lose their job which sees us through our darkest hours it is the firefighters courage to storm a stairway filled with smoke but also a parents willingness to nurture a child that finally decides our fate\n"
